# we yearn for a way of storing data that is flexible
# and breaks us from our old models. 
# Imagine each related collection of data not having 
# a type or model associated, no table no columns.
# you have a collection of data, that is somehow implicetly
# related. You have lots of these collections of data.
# Each implicetly related set of data is kept in a cell
# each cell keeps only one set of data. The cells are spaces
# defined by the intersection of an infinite set of planes
# or walls. If you were to look at every cell that shared
# a given wall, they would all somehow be related. A wall
# is a assertion. it's a condition. it's an edge of the
# cell's data

# data space
class Cell
end

# edge of a data space
class Wall
end

# way of viewing data spaces
class Lense
end

# result of looking through a lense
class View
end

# data cells have an infinate number of walls
# each wall is a condition
# each lense is a set of walls
# the view is the resulting cells we see through the lense
